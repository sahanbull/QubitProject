I am just the Dad ordering the stuff for my fashion conscious daughter so please reduce the prices!!!!
Have a 'save till later' function like asos

YOUR WEBSITE IS SLOW
Add more international delivery destinations!
Have a wish list that I can save items to and then at the end of the month when i get paid I remember what I wanted.

It'd be good if customers can be notified if the items in their shopping bag are low in stock because sometimes we take too long to consider and we need to be urged to make the purchase before the items become out of stock and we get really gutted with ourselves for taking our time.
I like the variety in styles & colors of your clothes.

Its got a very good collection of brands

i can't ship things to the united states
I think it is all perfect!

Holmes-Leather
the site is slow
I like the general layout
have a video of items like on asos
the site seems to crash a lot and freeze a lot which makes it increasingly difficult to browse online.
I like the ease of navigation
Lower prices....
apart from that site is great!
Make lower price.
you should ship products internationally with DDP (Shipping/tax/local duties) included.
have the option to choose which currency to view the prices in.
???? ????????? ? ????? ??????
the picture takes time to load.
brilliant layout..easy access to all items
Nothing to Improve.
I like that it shows what I've been looking at at the bottom so I can easily find it again without keeping a new tab for it.
the customer service is often really really bad

i liked everything
CHEAPER CLOTHES
i love your site for its clean cut.
more variety of shorts and lower the prices.
i can't because it's so expensive!
i think you should do a section where you can see what the item goes with to make it easier for people to buy a complete outfit rather than just one item :) x
I think to improve it there should be an option( if you loginto your account) to cancel an order within a certain timescale ie 30mins after placing order.
Love it!
I have never been here before.
If items are sold out - then by putting in a date when they will be back in stock would be good.
Love it.
gift card online!!
I like that you can view everything in one category on a single page rather than having to flick through 20 or so so different pages.
Please start delivering to Croatia so I can finally buy all the stuff I want from you on line.

love your history of advertising!

more of a range to pick from in one area of clothes eg jeans

Keep the shopping bag for longer

shopstyle.com.au
the thing i like about this site is the good description of all the clothes

Your Website is perfectly fine all the tools to shop are very complete
The only thing you dont offer that others do is that once the item is in your shopping bag it cant be sold to someone else unless you log off without checking out.

I love how easy it is to shop on you're website
i would like to have items kept in my bag for future log in if i decide to purchase items rather than have them deleted.
submenus from the MAN section does not work under chrome OSX
you can improve by making more sales
Like: Its easy to choose find what you are looking for i.e.
I think there should be more cotton dresses as they are much cooler in the hot weather.
Sometimes the filters cause it to crash&#44; or don't work
get more stock when you have a sale!!!!!!!

It should be possible to see the prices in euros
You would get fewer returns and happier customers - of that I'm sure.

Give me a 50% on a pair of shoes I like and I'll give you great advice
So&#44; more maternity wear would be great - most particularly underwear (bras) for bigger boobs&#44; more choice of jeans (ie bootcut/boyfriend) and more everyday maternity wear
I like how clear and well organised the site is.

I like the variety of different styles of clothing
Nothing!

REDUCE DELIVERY CHARGE
Nothing.

Complaint is not about the site - it's about the delivery to Lai Yap of 2 Herbert Gardens&#44; Kensal Rise&#44; London NW10 3BU on 06/02/13
I think that you shoul make your items cheaper
i'm in France and I want to know if you deliver in Paris

As well as more cheaper items.
You guys are too good to improve :D
more items needed in the home section
lower your prices in canada
it needs to be cheap
Infact I think this web site is very old fashioned & needs to be updated immediately if not sooner!
add a search by colour feature
I Like how easy it is to find things :)
please use euro amounts
make things cheaper!!
I like the edgy cook feel about your website.
i think you could make improvements by giving me discount on shoes :-)
Fantastic checkout process
It's amazing!!!!!!

Have Better Pictures!
do a poo
Wishlists
have a saved list like asos instead of recently viewed
no matter where i access this site from i find it very difficult to get on and loading of the pages take such a long time.
cheaper prices
or what?
delivery to argentina and other major countries
some things are way too expensive
What I like about your site is the many different style you have to offer ...
Pay for our duty :)
Replacing popular items when they have sold out.
Your site is stylish
remember the type of clothing I like and buy and only suggest those types of things.
There is a very good selection of clothes displayed to choose from.In my view no improvemnets are necessary
I think your site is really well laid out - logical and easy to navigate
is not colorful!
can't figure out how to 'click' returns tab
easy to navigate - and whenever i forget my password - which happens frequently - its easy to get another one sent through!
thus persuading people to buy it.
You should make a wishlist option where customers can save what they would like to possibly purchase when returning to the site
Just ordered&#44; lovely looking flowers at a great price
nothing I can think of!
Lower the prices please.
g345rtyq54ty

your prices are ridiculous
It its well designed!
great!
the layout and design is very good and modern.
I like how it is set out&#44; however&#44; you could have a wider range on clothes choice
larger range of size 9 ladies shoes
very unique
you should open more clothes outlets especially at penang.
free delivery would improve it tenfold
accept student cards that are not just nus extra please!
hurry up loading a bit
MAKE YOUR DOC MARTINS CHEAPER
everything until now is ok.
The websites good BUT you really need to make it possible to use gift cards online.

it's fine as it is
You can add Laser Card payments as i'm from Ireland and cannot use it on your site!
Have an online dressing room like H&M where you can see what the clothes and outfits look like on people.
slow loading
do deliver first and than pay because when it not fit you have to waith on your money
I like the sun fluted coat in navy
make it work

Very quick and easy to use one of the best online shopping sites.

I dislike that your size guide doesnt give details for S M and L sizings so as to compare them to standard sizing (i.e.
they are very expensive
shocking
cheaper clothes please...
for shop?ng
PERFECT
i like shopping online and its easy
its simple and easy to use
Looks great.
free delivery with items over £100?
the website should offer euros as well as pounds?

Great design.
inseam of the jeans according to size .
I like the price

It is really annoying having to scroll all the back down to where you were every time.
It's very simple to navigate and the whole site has a very blank feel so that the items stand out.
Ship to Norway.
Making it clear to choose which currency you would like to use

the lay out is really helpful for doing broad searches and is also easy to classify your search into particular brands
Great layout and easy to use.
flop !!!!
It's loading process is very very slow
I think that you should offer a 'what to wear it/how to style it section' such as offered by the personal shopping
a currency converter
Your site is very organized.
very slow
more comme des garson please
takes too long to load
need cheaper shoes your too expensive
The option to convert GBP to EUR
I hope you guys will do shipping to Singapore as well...
Sometimes it's kind of slow.
<script>alert('HELLP');</script>
When you return to the page you were on after clicking to view an item&#44; you are automatically sent back to the top of the page&#44; this is annoying as I lose my place
i am brand new to this site and love how it has been curated thus far!!!
Put the telephone number on to contact the store directly

Saves trawling through big long lists of items.
shipping is annoying.
So far...so good!
So easy to use.
when you are selecting which kind of accessory or top etc you want (on the left side/column) it would be better if you could select more than one.
Have a way to check the balance of your giftcard.

I like the clothes
A bigger selection of shoes
The lookbook provides a useful alternative when we want to view items on a model or gain inspiration.

I don't feel that you showcase a range worthy of this.
lower your prices so I can buy things from your site.
prices!
Sofie d'hoore dress
This means you have to scroll back down again to get to the point you left which is a real pain!

You can improve on sending out password reminders - it took so long to come that I had to use the phone line which you charge at national phone rates.
I think you should improve your online system with adding a reserving service.

MAKE EVERYTHING AFFORDABLE&#44; NOT 100 QUID FOR A BIT OF LACE
I would like to see a posibility to reserve items for a time period before the eitem is free for someone else to shop or you have to complete the buy.
i like the new function of being able to save my basket and save items of clothing for later.

EASY TO FIND WHAT YOUR LOOKING FOR
nothing to improve
you could improve: when you add something to the basket and then go back to carry on looking it doesnt show straight away in the corner that its saved to the basket?
No information supplied about opening hours!!!
Provide more colors in dress types
I like it..
the price is too high that I can't afford it.
lower delivery charges
send to america!
its help ful and organised.
i think student discount should be higher and it would be great if delivery was free i would definitely buy more
Of course not!
Tte price of the item which i was going to buy changed during the purchasing process (+50 EUR).
very easy to navigate
Not separately.
Charging for delivery AND returns is a total rip-off compared to other online sites
easy navigation
favourites/wish list option

Now this is what I call a fabulous idea...you don't have to listen to this request
make ur clothes more affordable

To be able to select more than one option in style of clothing and colour in the specific search options
Have a place where you can save items you like until your next visit.

Acknowledge your orders and keep your customers up to date with what's happening!!!!
can you deliver items to the nearest store?

Everything takes a long time to move from one screen to another.
I like the layout of the website and the colours are simple so you can easily see the products on the screen
It's great :D
a wish list or somewhere to remember or save items of clothing
too too slow
could be added to each of the bows of things.
I WANT A BURBERRY COAT :(
it isnt on the website and i dont know if it is a past item or will be coming in soon
need to sell bedroom furniture
i'd love to see you do catwalk vid clips like asos.
If I could mention one thing to be improved I was say maybe brighter more vibrant colours possibly.
....answering the phone would be a good start guys...
Should add a quick add to basket when you hover over and item rather than having to click on each item individually
i hope if there is more things in armani jeans.

I think you should do endless scrolls because it's a bit annoying pressing next page when you're just enjoying browsing for clothes/accessories
should put store opening hours on here
phone number for customer service contact
stock levels
when browsing e.g.
I don't like that the original pricing information for sale items is so volatile.
add a sort by price
i love your shorts guys !!
DELIVERY DETAILS FOR BFPO NUMBERS
I love the products.
Your site is so easy to navigate and is very easy on the eye.
Very slow!
nice colour scheme.
Delivery to store or check stock in store
dont delete everything from the basket so fast.
There are often items still listed that are out of stock.
There should be a place where customers can leave a review.
i like it because you can see all the clothing clearly and the details and i dont think you could improve it

Everything and Nothing.
When an item is added to the shopping bag there should be a way to go back to the exact place on the page of where you found it before.
New label research is poor.
make it where you can email the picture of the dresses to a friend.
